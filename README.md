# populationSimulator
This population simulator is one of my earlier independent projects. It is meant to simulate a human population with specific tolerance
levels to illustrate how and why the world is demographically arranged the way it is. 

# Results
This program clearly shows what happens when a population doesn't have enough tolerance and that is the world goes into shambles. 
It shows that minority groups tend to take longer to find a place they belong. It also had the surprising result that there exists a 
point where people can have too much tolerance and that results in a vast majority of people being happy with a select few that just can't 
seem to find somewhere to belong. The implication of this in the real world might suggest that although a large amount of acceptance and 
tolerance for others is desirable, there still exists a need to be surrounded by people that you have simlarities with. 

Now, that being said, I am no psychoogist and this program is <b>not to be used with racial groups</b>, nor is it accurate in the slightest 
to be used in that scope. Rather use it anologis to people who have similar belives, ideals, hobbies. I'd much rather see this used to 
predict how a Toronto Maple Leaf's fan feels when sitting in the Winnipeg Jet's crowd.
